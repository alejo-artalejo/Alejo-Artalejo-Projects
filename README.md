I’m Alejo Artalejo, a CompTIA Secure Infrastructure Specialist (CSIS) certified in Security+, Network+, and A+ with hands-on experience in network infrastructure, system administration, and cybersecurity.

At Smart City Networks, I design, install, and maintain fiber-optic and Ethernet networks for large-scale convention environments — managing IDFs, MDFs, and ensuring network reliability. I use tools like Fluke LinkRunner, Grafana, AWX, and Cisco WLC for monitoring and troubleshooting.

Currently pursuing a B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance at Western Governors University (WGU), I’m continuously expanding my technical expertise toward cloud security engineering.

## Objective

To leverage my skills in network infrastructure, system administration, and cybersecurity to transition into a Cloud Security Engineer role — focusing on secure architecture, automation, and system hardening.
